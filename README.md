# OSINT Projects
For German version of this README, see [README_DE.md](README_DE.md)

This folder contains my collection of beginner-friendly OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) projects.  
Each project is organized into its own subfolder with a dedicated README explaining its purpose, usage, and limitations.

## Current Projects

1. **Username Checker** (`osint_username_checker`)  
   - A simple script to check if a username exists on GitHub, TikTok, Instagram, and X/Twitter.  
   - Only public profiles are reliably detected.  
   - [See project README for details](./osint_username_checker/README.md)

2. **Domain Information Tool** (`domain_information_tool`)
   - A simple script to look up various types of domain information.
   - Supports: WHOIS lookup, DNS resolution, IP geolocation, server fingerprints and Shodan host reports.
   - Shodan host reports are experimental.
   - [See project README for details](./domain_information_tool/README.md)
